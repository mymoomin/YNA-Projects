## rsleep
Chooses a random image edit based off Heartful Punch from Sleepless Domain telling you to go to sleep.
See them all at https://imgur.com/a/B0E2T.
When called inside a tag, defines a function Sleep that returns an image telling you to go to sleep.
### GenericSleep
A version of rsleep that returns only the image, not the tag associated with it.
## Character
When called inside a tag, defines a function, {character}, that outputs a random character. The first argument (sd, kd, or any) determines what comic the character is from, and the second (adults, kids babbus, or nothing) determines the age range. It can also be called directly.
Characters of no defined age are in every age range, and Anemone is an adult.
